# Lecture 1 – Introduction to software testing
## Expectation
- testing methodology
- security testing framework
- types of testing
- theoretical vs. practical
- industry suggestion
- case study 
- discover how it is exciting!
- 3 assignments & 1 exam
1 personal(20%) + 1 peerwise(5%) + 1 group(25%) + 1 exam(50%)


## What is software testing? And Why do we do it?
1. find errors of the software + increase confidence that no errors
2. software meets specification (comparison between existing and reuqired conditions)
3. protect against vulnerabilities **security**
4. software is robust
5. testing presences bugs, not finds bugs

### Why someone else to test your program?
- Reason 1 whole assumption when testing
- Reason 2 creation is hard to break it down

1. Make sure code meets expected requirements, including other artefacts that are produced
2. Code can produce expected results
3. Make sure our program does not break under certain conditions
4. Works for all edge cases
5. Validating that we are headed in the right direction: i.e. we are building the right product
rather than just building the product right
6. To help development; e.g. re-run tests after re-factoring (regression testing)
7. Tim’s definition: break our software

## What is a “successful” test case?
1. Meets the expected output(select cases)
2. If it fails! (break the software) -> improve quality of the software
3. quick and easy way to break the software
